title: How to read the Huboard
---

So I've updated the website a tiny bit with more links (as well as doing more coding when I can). The most useful, and possibly confusing bit is the Huboard link. Just to be clear, this is how I use Huboard. I'm a lone dev making a relatively small project with at least a filter of control over all of the content that goes on here. Other people or groups will use this tool differently. I will also certainly evolve my process with this tool (or even find a new one!), so nothing's set in stone and nothing is for everyone.

### What on earth is Huboard, anyway?

[Huboard](http://www.huboard.com) is this sweet site that integrates with GitHub's issue tracker. I've actually been using GitHub for a while now with this project, and I started using the issue tracker last summer. I like it a lot, but it lacked prioritization and easier long-term planning. Huboard plugs in to that (for free if the project is open-source!) and tacks on those features while still keeping the underlying issues fairly usable. I can go and prioritize on Huboard, and as they've been rolling out new features I can actually handle most if not all of my issue-based workflow there. 

### Milestone view

**Edit:** Huboard's new layout doesn't work well the way I like it, so I switched to "release goals" for this view.

Milestone view is what I predict is the most immediately interesting to some one other than me. This gives a high-level, abstract roadmap of "all the things I'm pretty sure I want to do".

It's not a commitment, it's not set in stone. It's really just a place where I can put things to remember that I eventually want to do them. When I was working on a prototype of this game as a school project, I actually forgot that I'd even included a giant feature in the scope of the goals! This view aims to help me not forget big things.

* Milestones are roughly features. Especially early on, it's often broader than that, but that's the rough equivalent I use.
* It's prioritized by 'feature', left-most being the next thing I want to do. Sometimes it makes sense to snag one 
* Milestones have sub-tasks/stories. These are very roughly prioritized by what needs to come first to make the feature happen. I don't really pay a ton of attention to this most of the time, see more below about the Tasks View.
* I'm really bad at sticking to this, and things don't always fit right. Sometimes there's a thing I know needs to be done, but doesn't have a good place to live.
* Tasks/stories/issues tagged with the green arrow ("Ready for next stage") are what I'm planning for the next update. I probably won't mark them at all until what I'm working on gets close to finished.
* Anything with a check-mark is done. It's not released, but it's ready to roll out and is positive progress toward goals.

### Tasks View

The Tasks-centric view is where I spend most of my time on Huboard. For my purposes, I treat this as a unit of work. Everything on here is what I want to get done before the next update/release. At time of writing, it's everything that needs to be done before I'm comfortable releasing a super-early pre-alpha to the public.

Because it's just me, I don't use the "Working" column like most teams would. Working, to me, is "the absolute next thing to do". It might be that I'm actively working on it right that second, but I'll also usually set that whenever I finish other tasks and get it clear. It's sort of an "on-deck circle", if you'll pardon the baseball term.

Ready and Done are much more self-explanitory. If something's going to go in this update and it hasn't been worked, it's in the Ready slot. Anything in Done is, well, done. When everything's in done, I'll close and archive all of that, spend some time putting together the actual update/release, and pull in the next set of work from the Backlog column. Rinse and repeat.

### Obligatory summary

I'd like to take a moment to stress again that I don't use either of these features as what I'm committed to doing. I'm also really awful about just doing something and not making an issue to see it, particularly with simple-seeming fixes.

But hopefully that's a useful overview and the concept of opening my development process to the world doesn't come back to bite me later.
