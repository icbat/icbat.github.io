title: Preparing for Alpha
---

Now is a time when I feel like I should be working on this game more. I'm really excited (and anxious, apprehensive, etc.) about releasing the first playable version of Tradesong in to the wild.

Originally, I planned on showing the initial alpha to only a handful of people. As time has gone by, I think it'd be easiest to open it up to the wild at about the same time. Hopefully that's the right decision, but I suppose only time will tell that.

There's a few big things that need to happen before the game can be 'released', both in and out of the code.

### In the code
- Money
- A basic shop interface
- Contracts (by far the biggest thing remaining)

### Outside factors
- This site needs more links, particularly to the huboard to publicize the roadmap
- A super basic FAQ needs to go up here
- A way to be notified of updates. Even if it's just a dedication to updating Twitter or something.
- A link on the site for the download, and a very obvious reminder that this is alpha.
- A standard system for feedback. Maybe just Twitter for that too, I suppose.
- Pay attention to some Feedback Fridays before I release, so I know what to expect!

There's basically a lot of little things (and one semi-daunting feature) left. And then a ton of things after that, but this'll be a big milestone for me. This'll be the first piece of software that I've made and then publicized at all. It's nervewracking. I realize that the game is nowhere near where I want it to be, but I suspect that goal will be easier to reach with more eyes giving feedback.

It should also help keep me motivated to press on and get it done.
