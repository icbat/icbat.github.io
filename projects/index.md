Things I've been working on:

<div><a href="{{site.url}}/projects/minigames">Minigames</a>

Every once in a while, I get the bright idea to make a game in a small amount of time. These are those.

<div><a href="{{site.url}}/projects/tradesong">Tradesong</a>

In college, I made a game as my senior project, and continued to try and iterate on it after graduation. I'm not particularly proud of it, but here it is in all its young, insecure, inexperienced glory.
