A build-your-own-bundle companion for Itch.io!

**This is now defunct. itch.io changed their site around a bit and broke this as an unexpected result**

I was browsing itch.io's GitHub [issue repo](https://github.com/itchio/itch.io/issues). I was originally hoping to find something to contribute to, but alas, the main site is not open source (but the [desktop app](https://github.com/itchio/itch) is!). Curious, though, I looked at the oldest issues, and [this one](https://github.com/itchio/itch.io/issues/12) caught my eye.

So I made it happen. The tiny app would parse an XML view of all the games for under $x dollars and return you random bundles. It was neat, even if no one ever used it.
