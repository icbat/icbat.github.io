It's 2016 and I'm still playing WoW. And making addons for it!

I dig WoW. I've been playing (very) off-and-on since around 2005. In 2006/2007, I raided almost full time (I was in high school).

Long ago, I tried making an addon, but never really followed through with it. Now, in 2016, I have done the thing. I made an addon and it's pretty useful to me.

All it does is scan the Looking For Group page for the bonus role-based rewards, so I can carry on with my day instead of constantly opening that panel and clicking through dropdowns to find out if I should be running dungeons.

The whole thing took about a weekend, and it was actually a lot of fun. Lua is interesting, bucking a lot of conventions I'm used to in favor of a small, understandable syntax.
