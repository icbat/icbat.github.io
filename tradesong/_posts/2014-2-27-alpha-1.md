title: Alpha "release" finalized
---

I'm done. I built a .JAR. That's what makes a great game, right?

But seriously, I'm really excited and anxious to have a deadline/done-state. It's obviously not permanent or anywhere near complete, but it's been very good for me to have this arbitrary deadline with which to work. Tomorrow night I'm having some friends over to do some in-person alpha testing, and I'll be doing the same at the end of March as well, working on feedback and new features between now and then.

Still completely unsure how tomorrow will go, but I've been assured it'll be fun regardless. 

It's not like there's a ton of things bugging me about how it looks right now. See:

There won't be a released executable this time, as there's some licensing ish that needs to be worked out first, but I'm aiming to silently release an alpha build next time so I can point random folks on the Internet to it when they need to feel better about themselves.
