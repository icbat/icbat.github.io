title: Adding in some fun
---

I've been hard at work on this, just not posting here... I haven't had anything to show!

I demo'd to some friends (@Zykenhouzen and @aadmiral) mid-March, and got a ton of good feedback. And I was off to making new things!

But first I had to clean up my horrific mess.

At my day job, I maintain this (dreadful) legacy codebase. I spend a lot of my spare thought-cycles wishing I could rip whole "classes" out (all 4000+ lines of them!) and make something sensical and maintainable, but alas, that's rarely in the sprint points. 

But Tradesong, that's my project! I can assign the points! And I have assigned them to reworking everything. Everything. No really, everything.

* The HUD was ripped out and rewritten.
* Cleaned up the way stages and maps are handled behind the scenes.
* Made notifications an integral part and not just tagged on. Instead of eating your screen and causing a bunch of weird bugs, they have a place on the HUD now.
* I started making re-usable components for making the new crafting workflow

Which is to say, all of this was to make it acceptable for me to make something new and flashy:  I'm redoing crafting to make it actually fun!

### The old

Crafting in the first few alphas was really a placeholder, whether past-me would've admitted that or not. It was essentially Minecraft-crafting, in one dimension (1x3 instead of a 3x3 grid.) That's not fun.

Honestly, when playing Minecraft, that's one of my least favorite aspects. If I were a more pure, immersed gamer, I'd spend time trying to figure out combinations and make new things. I am not; I end up just keeping a browser pointed at the Wiki the whole time.

### The new

But there is something I love when playing and crafting in Minecraft:  mods. Specifically those you'd typically find in the Tekkit packs or in Voltz. The ones that let you automate crafting, plug machines together, etc.

Often I'd find myself spending whole evenings making a needlessly complex machine that really just saved me ~15 minutes of my life when it was finished. But the plugging of those pieces together was fun!

So that's where Tradesaong is going. I've got an idea and some rough drawings, but I have nothing pretty to show today. Just the promise of work, to myself. I'm just happy something flashy is the next thing on my list.
