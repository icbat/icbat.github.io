title: Closing in on an alpha
---

As every good [fishmonger out of watermonger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXiQSxQ4Q6w#t=379) knows, it's important to have arbitrary deadlines. So I've set my first few.

* Feb 28 - First round of Alpha testing
* March 31 (Tentative) - Second round of Alpha Testing

The original idea for how I'd initially test was from a post on [r/gamedev](http://gamedev.reddit.com), which I can no longer locate. I've heard this echoed often, though. I'll get some people to play the game, and take thorough notes on their experiences while giving as little guidance as I can manage.

Now that I think about it, when I've play-tested games at GenCon in the past, that's actually what the game makers have been doing.

As far as progress, it's actually going quite nicely. I've still got just under 2 weeks to do the rest, and I got to the point I pulled in 'stretch goals' for this. I wasn't planning on having the Tinker workshops implemented, but I think I'm going to have the time to do so. It'll also add some much-needed depth to the alpha. I'm also cleaning up a lot of the nasty code and assets.

The alpha is closed in that it's only people that I'm inviting for now. I'll be posting some screenshots of the alpha product, if for no other reason than to have documentation of how ugly my maps and work can be. It should be fun to reminisce over, but I hope that showing the nasty screenshots doesn't hurt me later. A big thing on my "future things" plate is to make the whole game prettier. I've not deluded myself enough to think that neon-green text all the time is a good thing; it's merely been a useful place-holder. With something nasty like that, I see it every time I run the game and it irks me enough to change it later.

This game has already been a great boon to my iteration skills, and I'm sure I'll keep getting better over time.
