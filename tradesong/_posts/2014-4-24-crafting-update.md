title: Crafting rework in place!
---

Yay! Another new release of Tradesong. Long and arduous and not very well polished.

I've been hard at work re-doing crafting. The old crafting was "put up to 3 things in a box, see if it makes something". This new setup is a step toward fun and a big step toward understandable interactions that wouldn't require an outside resource.

It also pretty much obliterates the idea of professions that were hinted at. In the original draft/contract for making Tradesong as my senior project, I was required to make 3 professions. That didn't really fit with how I wanted things to work, so now there are no "professions". Instead, there's just work!

Items flow downward from a chest and will get sucked in and processed by compatible stations. One of the big things I'd like to release sooner rather than later is an update that includes a way to see what all a station will eat, and how things are going through the process. 

I also added save files. I promise not to break your saves after, say, an actual release. But expect them to break every alpha release, and probably most if not every beta release, too.

Cheers!
