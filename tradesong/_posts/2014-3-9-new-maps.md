This month I've been focusing on expanding the content manually. A little preview of what I've been working on this month.

So there's one of three new maps I've whipped up. The old map for testing is just rectangle with a few layers. This one's a lot more visibly interesting already, and I don't love it yet. I'll keep working on it (and the other two maps) so they stay valuable throughout the game's development, but I desperately needed something different to look at and to show people.

One "problem" I've ran in to this month has been too much motivation and not enough ambition. Here's some highlights of what I've accomplished in 9 days:

* Fixed a few bugs
* Added 15 or so new items and got the process down to be pretty easy
* Figured out how to do popup notifications in game and made a few to highlight events that weren't obvious before.
* Made 3 more maps and then did a polishing pass on them
* Updated how the "what spawns where" logic works and accounted for rarity, where more rare items should spawn less overall. Not sure I'm thrilled with the numbers but it's fine for now, as a proof-of-concept.

I'll be visiting my hometown next weekend to see friends and family, and to coerce them to play this for a bit and give me feedback, so I'm really happy to have this much "new stuff" to show off. That also means I'll probably spend most of next weekend working on this out of boredom, like I often do at my parent's house. It's not a bad thing at all, it's nice and relaxing and a neat place to work.

More and more each day, I'm starting to really like this workflow and game dev in general. I'd like to get to the point where I can comfortably do this as a part-time gig or something.
