title: Recap of how the first alpha test went
---

I had some friends over and let them loose on my game.

And it went pretty well, overall. They played through about 3-4 in-game "days" worth of content (total of about 15-20 minutes), found all the reachable recipes and seemed to enjoy themselves. I'm always a bit skeptical of friends' reactions; while I know most of them are honest enough to tell me if something is awful, I don't know if I should trust good feedback yet!

Here are some things that were bad, things that could have been better:
* Double/triple checking that what I thought was reachable was reachable. There were a few recipes that just didn't exist, or relied on things that weren't themselves reachable. Fewer things than I wanted were actually accomplish-able.
* Test on the platform first. My original plan was to have people come back, one at a time, and play on my PC that I develop on. The day of the event, I decided it'd be more fun/telling to see people as a group, so I used my Windows tablet. It has the same resolution as my desktop, but a much smaller aperture so the game itself was hard to interact with.
* I have no need to be so nervous about this sort of thing. But I was very, very nervous.

And here are some super-positive things that came of it:
* A big boost in motivation. Lately I've been thinking that maybe I could do this for a living, that I really like making games, and seeing people interact with something that I'd made was awesome. I ended up working a ton the rest of the weekend just riding the energy wave from that night. I'm already really looking to the next time I get to show this to someone.
* Turns out it's almost touch-ready. I played around by myself before people came over and wondered if I could just touch the screen and play. Everything worked fine if you could touch it accurately enough. Thanks, [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)!
* Got some great ideas/feedback. I had written off something like a Cooking profession, even though I have a bunch of assets ready to roll for it. I didn't think it'd be interesting, but people actually assumed there was one based on what existed in the game already. The testers also found a few bugs I hadn't noticed, which is awesome.

Overall, I'm really happy with how it went. I'm glad I went with a group-play session, too. I can't wait for the next one!
