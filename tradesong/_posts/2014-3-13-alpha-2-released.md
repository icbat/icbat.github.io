title: Alpha 2 released!

18 days early. Apparently I'm a very pessimistic estimator.

It's out there, it's on here! Go grab it and tell me what you think =)

I don't know how I felt like this would be a huge milestone to hit, I felt overwhelmed at the start of it, but everything's going really smoothly. I'm definitely hitting some sort of "stride" or "rhythm" and dev is getting easier and faster. 

Still not sure if I'm doing "you can save you game" or just random polish stuff next.
