Made for the Global Game Jam 2016, this is a game about that most sinister of rituals:  brushing your teeth.

Brushie Brushie was made as part of a five person team, featuring:

 - Becky Asbury
 - Mark Hall
 - Sam Jantz
 - Peter Zylka
 - myself

It was made over the course of one weekend, using [PhaserJS](https://phaser.io). The source code is [here](https://github.com/hackernight/gamejam2016).

I barely touched the code for this one, I spent most of my time helping facilitate work and a bit of audio.

See if you can clean those teeth!
