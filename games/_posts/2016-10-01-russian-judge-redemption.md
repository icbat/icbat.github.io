Made for the STL Scatterjam 2016, help the Russian Judge redeem himself by judging interpretive dance!

Russian Judge Redemption was made as part of a four person team, featuring:

 - Becky Asbury
 - Brandon Kassebaum
 - Peter Zylka
 - myself

It was made over the course of one weekend, using [PhaserJS](https://phaser.io). The source code is [here](https://github.com/hackernight/scatterjam-2016).

I did a lot of code and helping others get used to Phaser here. I'm especially proud of the dancer's movement; that was the biggest thing I worked on (rigging the arms and hands, etc).

Help Ivan redeem himself by making his score close to the other judges'!
